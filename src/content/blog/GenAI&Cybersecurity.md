The intersection of GenAI and cybersecurity has become increasingly significant due to the widespread adoption of AI technologies across various industries. **GenAI is revolutionizing cybersecurity by automating threat detection, identifying anomalies, and enabling proactive risk management**. However, as with any powerful tool, it introduces new challenges that must be addressed to ensure robust security.

For instance, deepfake detection and management have become some of the most insidious threats in the AI security landscape. These methods can bypass traditional authentication mechanisms through synthetic media generation. In addition, real-time voice cloning and video manipulation at scale present significant concerns, as they can be used to create highly convincing fraudulent content.

In this blog, we will **focus on multiple techniques for ensuring the security of large language model** (LLM) **applications**.

# Best practices for building a complex application using LLM:

Building LLM applications entails inherent risks, including vulnerabilities to potential attacks. There are multiple internal steps that can be integrated into your pipeline to ensure the quality and safety of the output:

- **Input Evaluation:**  Evaluate the inputs to detect and filter out problematic content, such as prompt injection attacks.
- **Input Classification:** Analyze and categorize inputs to determine what type of query it is. This classification allows us to decide how to process each query appropriately. 
- **Information Retrieval:** Retrieve relevant information necessary for generating accurate and factual responses, ensuring reducing the model hacullinations.
- **Output Validation:** Evaluated the generated outputs to identify inaccuracies or inappropriate content.


## Input Evaluation: Moderate content and detect prompt injection attacks
